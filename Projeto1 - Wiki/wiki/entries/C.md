# C (programming language)

The C language also exhibits the following characteristics:

- It has a large number of arithmetic, bitwise, and logic operators: +,+=,++,&,||, etc.
- More than one assignment may be performed in a single statement.
- Low-level access to computer memory is possible by converting machine addresses to typed pointers.
- Complex functionality such as I/O, string manipulation, and mathematical functions are consistently delegated to library routines.
- The language has a small, fixed number of keywords, including a full set of control flow primitives: if/else, for, do/while, while, and switch. User-defined names are not distinguished from keywords by any kind of sigil.
- And more!

Since 2000, C has consistently ranked among the top two languages in the TIOBE index, a measure of the popularity of programming languages.
